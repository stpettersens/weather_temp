Build requires:

* `make` to use the Makefile.
* [LDC](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc) compiler ([DMD](https://github.com/dlang/dmd) should also work if you swap out `ldc2` for `dmd` in the Makefile) .
* [UPX](https://github.com/upx/upx) is an optional build dependency if you want to compress the produced `coldfear_retail.exe`.
